			<a href="http://quickandeasysoftware.net">http://quickandeasysoftware.net</a></span><br><br>
		</span>

	<p class="style7"><strong><em>New in this version (1.5.1):</em></strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Fixed bug with The Walking Dead 201. The previous version dumped the music from the menu instead of the episode.</li><br>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="style7"><strong><em>New in the previous version (1.5.0):</em></strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Added support for The Walking Dead 400 Days, The Walking Dead Season 2 Episode 1 and The Wolf Among Us Episode Two. 
		<li class="style7">Added support for the remainder of the episodes of The Walking Dead Season 2 and The Wolf Among Us. Assuming that the file format and naming convention remain the same - new episodes should work without me needing to update the program.
		<li class="style7">Cleanup of the source to make it more manageable. Everything should be fine but if anything has broken please let me know.</li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="style7">It may work with future games, but will need updating if the game is encrypted as the encryption key is different for every game.</p>
	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>What do I need to use this?:</strong></em><br> 
		Just the games themselves.
	</p>
	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>How to use it:</strong></em><br>
		1) Click on the top folder icon and either click on 'open folder' and choose a folder yourself or choose one of the games and the folder will be found automatically. <br>
		2) Click on the bottom folder icon and choose a destination folder.<br>
		3) Click Go. <br>
		4) If soundtrack dumping is available for a game then a messagebox will ask you if you want to dump as a soundtrack. See below for an explanation of what this means.
	</p>

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>Soundtrack support:</strong></em><br>
		Some games are able to be dumped as 'soundtracks'. This means that the music will be dumped as though it were a soundtrack cd, with better filenames and tracknames, tags in the dumped music and (optionally) - album art.<br>
		Dumping as a soundtrack is optional and not available for every game. If its available then a messagebox will ask you if you want to dump the music as a soundtrack.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p class="style7"><em><strong>Creating soundtrack files:</strong></em><br>
		Soundtrack support is activated by creating an .ini file and putting it in the 'Soundtracks' folder. At the moment only OGG files are supported for soundtracks, although support for MP3 and WAV files could be added if requested. The format is fairly straighforward and you can get an idea from looking at the included ini's but the following is a brief guide to the structure of a soundtrack ini file.<br><br>
		
		Each ini must have an [Info Header] section that will look something like this:<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;[Info Header]<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Title=Launch of the Screaming Narwhal<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;UniqueFile1=town-glass<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;UniqueFile2=desinge-weird<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;UniqueFile3=restore-winds<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Album=Tales Of Monkey Island: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Artist=Michael Land<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Year=2009<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Genre=Game<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverart=Tales Of Monkey Island- Launch of the Screaming Narwhal.jpg<br><br>
		
		UniqueFile 1, 2 and 3 are used to automatically identify the game that the ini corresponds to. These 3 entries should be filenames that are unique and only appear together in that game.<br>
		Album, artist, year and genre are used to create the audio tags in the dumped files. Coverart is optional but should refer to the name of a coverart image in the 'Soundtracks' folder.<br><br>
		
		The rest of the entries will look something like this:<br><br>

		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;[main-theme-short]<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;TrackNo=04<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Title=Monkey Island Theme<br><br>
		
		The text between [] should be the original filename of the track.<br><br>
		
		If there are tracks that need to be merged then they need to look like this:<br><br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;[jungle]<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;TrackNo=16<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Title=Flotsam Jungle<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File1=jungle-doro<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File2=jungle-voodoo<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File3=jungle-merfolk<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File4=jungle-wind1<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File5=jungle-wind2<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File6=jungle-wind3<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File7=jungle-machine<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File8=jungle-machine-wind1<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File9=jungle-machine-wind2<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;File10=jungle-machine-wind3<br><br>
		
		The "File" entries are the original filenames of the tracks that need to be merged. So this example would merge the "jungle" track with the other 10 jungle files listed to make one track called "Flotsam Jungle".<br><br>
		
		Certain characters arent allowed in Windows filenames (/\:*?"|) so these are removed from filenames when dumping. They are included in the ID3/comment tags though.<br>
		There are two exceptions to this:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward slash character "/". If this is used then it becomes "-" in filenames. Eg "Title=Guybrush/Elaine Theme" would become Guybrush-Elaine Theme.ogg<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The colon character ":". If this is used then it becomes " -" in filenames. Eg "Title=Chapter One: The Start" would become Chapter One - The Start.ogg<br>

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>Limitations:</strong></em><br> 
		The tool only rips music. If you want to rip speech then download Telltale Speech Extractor from my <a href="http://quickandeasysoftware.net">website.</a><br>
		Soundtrack files - at the moment only OGG files are supported for soundtracks, although support for MP3 and WAV files could be added if requested.
